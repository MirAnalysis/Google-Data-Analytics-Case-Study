# Recommendations
Key strategies:

## 1. Market the features that Bellabeat offers which Fitbit users are already using.

 * Expand on the options to track physical activity with specific exercises tracking and coaching memberships for new workout plans.

  * Users are meeting the recommended time of moderate-vigorous active minutes so they are likely interested to see how they are performing day to day and can set new goals with the Bellabeat App.

  * Maintain active minutes or challenge themselves with the coaching membership.  

   * CDC also recommends resistance training which could be taught and monitored with the coaching feature.

  * Most users spend the majority of their active minutes performing light level exercise which users could better expand on with the ability to assign specific exercises such as yoga or walking to their daily activity. 

## 2. Market improved wellness by targeting areas of health tracking that the Fitbit data suggests users could use improvement in

 * Meet the recommended 7 hours of sleep with the sleep tracker and monitor their sleep cycles for better sleep health. 

 * Use the stress meter as a metric to evaluate how their sleep and activity are possibly impacting their mental health 

 * Get more than 7,000 steps (to decrease mortality rates) with the option to set step count goals.

 * Increase step and activity frequency with the inactivity alarm feature to improve midday decreased activity. 

 * The coaching membership can be used to round out the midweek plateau of activity displayed in the Fitbit data by being held accountable and/or given work out schedules.

## 3. Avoid marketing that focuses on weight loss, instead promote the positive and well rounded health feature: the Wellness Score. This sets Bellabeat apart from its competitors. 

 * The data suggests users do not have an interest in weight tracking as it was the least used feature.

 * The wellness score calculates overall health of the body and mind, not just a number on the scale which users may find refreshing and uplifting. It can also help them to stay motivated to track consistently by seeing a snapshot of their performance day to day. 

  * A focus on meditation, hydration, and other aspects that make up a healthy life imprints the brandâ€™s positive values on consumers. 

   * Marketing this feature will expand the ways current fitness tracking consumers can monitor their health but also widen the demographic to less fit consumers as a way to enter the health world in a non-intimidating way.

# In summary
 Bellabeat should continue to market their positive and well-rounded health monitoring services. Emphasize how their products, the Ivy and Leaf, can do all of the physical fitness tracking that Fitbit does that consumers like, but with the addition of the wellness score tool that can help them monitor other key aspects (hydration, stress, menstrual cycle) that make up a healthy life in an upbeat and stylish way!
