# Visual Representation of Findings

## Activity Findings

Activity is mostly light level but users are still meeting the recommended weekly minimum 150 minutes of activity. There is a trend that users become less active towards the end of the week across all activity levels.

There is a positive correlation between the more vigorous the activity level the more calories burned.

Users gradually stopped tracking activity data over time. Of the 33 users, only 22 competed the month.


## Step Findings

Users are typically getting around 7,000 steps. There is a noticeable decline in the number of users tracking their steps but also those that did track had significantly less steps

Users are typically taking more steps on Tuesdays and Saturdays with a plateau mid week.

On average the peak number of steps occurs in the evening and rapidly declines.

There is a positive correlation between taking more steps and burning more calories. 


## Sleep Findings

Two outliers were removed to more clearly see the data. The longer users sleep, the more time awake they will experience throughout their sleep cycles.

Users tend to get similar amounts of sleep across the week. They vary from getting the recommended amount to less than throughout the week. Users get the most sleep on Sundays but there is a decline in the beginning and end of the week.

Users are spending more time in bed awake on the weekends compared to weekdays.

Sleep Varies over time but averages just around 7 hours a night.

Not all users tracked sleep data each night. Users are tracking their sleep inconsistently.


## Daily Time Spent Findings

<img width="354" alt="Daily_Percents" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89226576/160309417-2ae3e9a8-c54b-4d21-b887-2db25a90e1ab.PNG">

 * There does not appear to be a significant difference in daily activity between the users who track weight and those that do not.
 * The greatest variance is that the overlap users tend to spend less time sedentary (-2%) and more time asleep (+1.5%)
 * The weight users may be getting more rested sleep since they get more sleep and less time awake in bed compared to the rest of the users. 


## Weight Findings

4 of the users with between 2-5 logs performed infrequent logs which may suggest that users prefer periodic weight check ins over daily monitoring.

Users with more weight logs had a greater percent change in body weight than those who only logged a few times. This could indicate users who track weight are more motivated to lose weight and as such lose more. 


<img width="273" alt="Number of Logs per Id for Weight" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89226576/160309265-ec059906-c458-4a59-bd1b-0a9ecabdfcf2.PNG">

Of the 8 users that did track weight data, only 2 did so a significant number of times.


## User Log Findings

<img width="363" alt="Logs by Type and ID" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89226576/160309288-7d03d3d2-efa3-4f60-91aa-f768e6f1bbfa.PNG">

Overall users are tracking activity data the most consistently and frequently. Sleep monitoring is still popular but much less consistent. Lastly weight tracking is nearly insignificant in comparison to the other types of monitoring. This suggests users are most interested in physical activity tracking.
