# Analysis (Trends Summarized)
 Key findings about user trends:

 ## 1. Activity
  * Users are on average are getting the recommended 150 minutes of vigorous and moderate exercise weekly.

  * More time is spent performing a light level of activity than moderate or very active levels.

  * All of the 33 users in the data sets tracked activity with 21 of them finishing the month with a daily log. 

 ## 2. Steps

  * On average users are getting 7,000 steps per day. According to a study, getting 7,000 steps and above decreases mortality rate.

  * Users gradually increase their step count throughout the day. There is a rapid rise and fall between 10am and 4pm with a peak around 6pm and then a rapid decline. 

  * The number of steps tends to decrease mid-week between Wednesday and Friday. 

## 3. Sleep

  * 24 of the 33 total users tracked sleep but with less commitment than seen with activity tracking. Only 15 of the 24 completed at least half of the month. Sleep tracking is inconsistent as users are logging sporadically not daily. 

  * Half of the users are meeting the recommended 7 hours of sleep per CDC guidelines  but the other half fall short. The average of all users results in 6.9 hours of sleep. 

  * On a weekly basis users fluctuate between getting 7 hours or just under around 6.8 hours.

  * The majority of the users have disrupted sleep of 15 minutes or more awake during their sleep cycles.

 ## 4. Weight

  * Only 8 of the 33 users tracked weight data and of them only 2 did so more than 5 times. 

  * Average pounds - 171.5

  * Average BMI 27.98 (25.0 to 29.9 falls within the overweight range according to the CDC)

 ## 5. Daily Percentage of activity 

  * The majority of time is spent sedentary and asleep followed by light leveled activity. 

  * There is not a significant variance between users tracking weight and those that do not in daily activity.
